            Adrian bagan cutting hair in 11th grade of high school at the age of seveteen years old. He would get his
            regular weekly haircuts at the local barbershop in Santa Monica, so he picked up his own clippers and began
            cutting his own hair. After a few tries, he finally nailed his haircuts. Adrian appreciated the art form of
            barbering and liked to service the diversity in mens hair. Now haircutting for over 22 years, Adrian is well
            known around his peers and multiple communities as a respected young veteran barber. Adrian received his
            barbers license from LA Barber College.

            “I like how I feel after a haircut. It changes everyting. I feel good when I provide a haircut or shave
            service and the customer feels that same feeling”

            —Adrian Lizarraga
